-- Just the essential fixes without complex logging

-- Create enum type safely
CREATE TYPE IF NOT EXISTS listing_status AS ENUM ('active', 'sold', 'expired');

-- 1. Fix spatial_ref_sys (system table)
REVOKE ALL ON TABLE public.spatial_ref_sys FROM PUBLIC;
REVOKE ALL ON TABLE public.spatial_ref_sys FROM anon;
GRANT SELECT ON TABLE public.spatial_ref_sys TO authenticated;

-- 2. Fix users table

    );

CREATE POLICY "Users can add themselves to threads" 
    ON public.participants FOR INSERT

    WITH CHECK (auth.uid() = user_id);

-- 7. Fix messages table
ALTER TABLE public.messages ENABLE ROW LEVEL SECURITY;

DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view messages in their threads" ON public.messages;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can send messages in their threads" ON public.messages;

CREATE POLICY "Users can view messages in their threads" 
    ON public.messages FOR SELECT 
    TO authenticated 
    USING (
        EXISTS (
            SELECT 1 FROM participants p 
            WHERE p.thread_id = messages.thread_id
